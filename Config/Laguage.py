                                <p>Interstitial is a utility for detecting interstitial errors in digitized audio files. The tool compares two sets of audio files - one generated by the DAW, and one saved to a secondary reference device - and reports any discrepancies between them. Interstitial will report any DAW-generated files with errors, as well as the time and sample at which the error occurred.</p> </br>
